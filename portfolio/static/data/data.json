    "about" : "I am a junior at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. As an engineer at heart I like to build things, such as this website and the projects in my projects section. As a member of IvLabs, a  student-run research community, I also discovered an interest in machine learning. I have further refined my skills and deepened my understanding of a few domains. I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries of technology and humbly contribute my expertise to impactful projects.",
